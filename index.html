        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Mia Lux Alabado. I was born and raised in a small suburban city south of San Francisco in the Bay Area called South San Francisco. I consider myself to be a passionate and ambitious individual. I tried my best to succeed in both my academics and extracurricular activities. I was class president in fifth, seventh, and eighth grade and was ASB president my senior year of high school, so I have great leadership experience. I also have a variety of work experiences, as I started my first job at 15 years old. From age 15 to 17, I worked under the city of South San Francisco at my local pool as a swim instructor. At the same time I was ASB president at my high school, I got my second job at my local Trader Joeâ€™s grocery store. I have been greatly involved with my community based on both my work and leadership experiences. <br><br>

        I am currently a second year in college at the University of California Riverside. I had never spent much time away from home, so I was both excited and nervous for what was to come of my college experience. I was not able to dorm on campus during my first year of college, so I had to live off campus. This made it very difficult to make close connections and network with my peers. To get myself involved and help myself feel more comfortable on campus, I joined a few organizations. I am a Filipina woman and grew up in a predominantly Filipino community, so I first joined the Filipino cultural organization and even got a position within a year of my membership. I also joined a pre-health fraternity on campus to help me figure out my career path after college. Both of these organizations have helped me assimilate to the pressures and culture of being in college. I hope to join more organizations when campus begins to open back up in Fall Quarter.
<br><br>

        It has definitely been anything but easy getting into the swing of college. I had yet to complete my first year until COVID-19 hit and I had to continue school in an online setting. I want to gain more work, volunteer, leadership experiences and all of the above, but being quarantined has been a huge setback in this situation. I am trying to remain optimistic and understand that we must put our health and safety first. In the meantime, I have signed up for non-clinical volunteering at COVID-19 vaccination clinics in my area. I am also searching for any internship opportunities, so I can prepare my schedule when things begin to open back up in the fall. 

I am a bit nervous to go back to campus, as COVID-19 has caused much anxiety throughout the world, but I trust and hope that UCR takes the proper precautions and care for their faculty, staff, and students. I hope to find more opportunities with what is left of my college career.
